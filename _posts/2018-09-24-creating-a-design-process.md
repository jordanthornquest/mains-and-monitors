# Creating a Design Process

I want to put together a modern, thorough, and consistent design process for proposing & developing websites. I am trying to find a balance of embracing what existing tools I use as a developer, and learning what tools to utilize as a designer. Iâ€™d like to be able to:

1. Sketch a design on a piece of paper, legibly.
2. Scaffold that design & framework it nimbly & interactively.
3. Visualize the design with an actual mockup.
4. Build it in code.

**How do I make this process functional & efficient?** I want to accomplish the tasks at hand & demonstrate competence, while avoiding redundancy. Given my experience as a developer, are there steps I can skip in the design process? Should I skip them?

## Step One: Creating Simple Sketches

Use a small notebook & pencil to work through basic ideas & designs. Store noteworthy designs in your Notes. You can also draw in Notes if that becomes a simpler process. The purpose is to use a pen or stylus to directly translate a design to paper, with as little specifics & semantics getting in your way as possible.

## Step Two: Use Sketch

Use Sketch to begin scaffolding & fleshing out the idea. This is the time to first build out a functional prototype, and then fine-tune it into a finished visual mockup. Used correctly, Sketch can help us finalize a design & get a complete vision for it, faster than I could ever do with a framework & code. The goal is to allow us to break out of using Frameworks when unnecessary: we want to be more creative, and embrace simpler, cleaner code.

## Step Three: Create The Code

Pick a framework & process based on the job that needs to be accomplished: whether to use a static framework, a headless CMS, an application framework, etc. Build the project with good foundations & practices.

The current question: how to most elegantly use the mockup to create the final product. Sketch allows us to create pixel-perfect spacing for content, so **how do we utilize a correctly-designed mockup to streamline the process of taking it to code?**
